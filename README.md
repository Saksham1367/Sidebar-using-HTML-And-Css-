# Sidebar Toggle with HTML and CSS

This project demonstrates a simple, responsive sidebar toggle using only HTML and CSS. The toggle functionality is achieved through the use of the `:checked` pseudo-class, providing an interactive experience without JavaScript.

## Features
- **CSS-Only Toggle**: Uses the `:checked` pseudo-class to show and hide the sidebar.
- **Simple and Clean Interface**: Easy-to-navigate sidebar with smooth transitions.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sidebar-toggle.git
    ```
2. **Open the Project**:
    - Navigate to the project directory.
    - Open `index.html` in your browser to see the sidebar in action.

## How It Works

- The sidebar is initially hidden off-screen.
- A checkbox input acts as a toggle switch, and its state is controlled by labels acting as buttons.
- When the checkbox is checked, the sidebar slides into view, utilizing CSS transitions.

## Customization

- Modify the styles in `styles.css` to change the appearance of the sidebar, buttons, and content area.
- Update the HTML in `index.html` to add more links or sections as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
